# GeneFinder
This is a python program that detects a protein-coding genes from arbitrary DNA sequences through a medhod called ab initio gene finding. This particular program finds genes from DNA of bacterium *Salmonella Enterica*. The output of this program, a DNA sequence that is suspected to be related to Salmonella's role in the pathogenesis, is then compared to the result from the genetic search engine protein-BLAST. This program was written as a mini-project for Olin College of Engineering Software Design Course in Spring 2016.
